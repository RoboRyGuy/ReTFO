Welcome to ReTFO, my collection of mods! This repo contains the source for mods that I have devloped.
The intent of these mods is to one day make a rundown containing all of them. However, each mod is
designed to be modular, such that other developers can take advantage of them where possible.

## ThermalOverlay

Currently the only mod I've released, ThermalOverlay grants the ability to give any item thermal vision.
Currently, this only really works on guns, but since 90% of users will only want to make guns thermal,
I think that's fine. I'll add configs for other weapons when I have a chance.
